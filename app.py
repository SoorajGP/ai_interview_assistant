        f"1. First determine whether the candidate actually answered the specific question being asked.\n"
        f"2. The answer must be relevant to the exact concept, class, algorithm, problem, or topic in the question.\n"

        f"even if the information provided is technically correct.\n"
        f"4. A completely off-topic answer should normally receive 0-2 marks.\n"
        f"5. If the answer is relevant, carefully evaluate the technical claims for factual correctness.\n"
        f"6. Before assigning marks, identify the important factual claims made by the candidate.\n"
        f"7. Check each important technical claim against your own technical knowledge and the reference answer.\n"
        f"8. Distinguish clearly between correct concepts, missing concepts, and incorrect technical claims.\n"
        f"9. A technically incorrect claim must reduce the score even if the answer is detailed, fluent, or confident.\n"
        f"10. Multiple major technical errors must prevent a high score.\n"
        f"11. Do NOT give 9-10 marks to an answer containing major factual misconceptions.\n"
        f"12. Correct statements that go beyond the reference answer should receive credit and should NOT reduce the score.\n"
        f"13. The candidate does NOT need to use the same wording as the reference answer.\n"
        f"14. Accept technically correct explanations that use different wording, terminology, examples, formulas, "
        f"or structure.\n"
        f"15. Do not penalize an answer simply because it is more detailed than the reference answer.\n"
        f"16. Do not award marks merely because the answer is long. Judge the technical content.\n"
        f"17. Write a brief, conversational response of 1-3 sentences addressed directly to the candidate. "
        f"Validate correct points, gently correct important misconceptions, and mention important missing concepts when appropriate.\n\n"

        f"Scoring:\n"
        f"18. Evaluate the answer using these four dimensions:\n"
        f"   - Relevance: 0-2 marks. Does the answer directly address the specific question?\n"
        f"   - Technical correctness: 0-4 marks. Are the important technical claims correct?\n"
        f"   - Completeness: 0-2 marks. Does the answer cover the essential concepts required by the question?\n"
        f"   - Clarity: 0-2 marks. Is the explanation clear and understandable?\n"
        f"   Add these four values to obtain the final score out of 10.\n\n"

        f"19. If the answer is completely off-topic, normally give 0-2 marks.\n"
        f"20. If the answer is relevant but contains major technical misconceptions, normally give no more than 5 marks.\n"
        f"21. If the answer is relevant, mostly correct, but has important omissions or minor errors, give partial credit.\n"
        f"22. An answer should receive 9-10 marks only when it is relevant, technically accurate, and substantially complete.\n"
        f"23. Correct additional information must not reduce the score.\n"
        f"24. Do not confuse confidence, length, or detail with correctness.\n\n"

        f"You MUST format your output EXACTLY using these XML tags. Do not output anything else:\n"
