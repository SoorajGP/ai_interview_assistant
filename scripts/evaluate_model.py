    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This report evaluates the <strong>Adaptive LLM Interview System</strong>, which uses a
      LoRA-fine-tuned <strong>Qwen1.5-1.8B</strong> language model to score candidate answers
      during a simulated technical interview. The system adapts difficulty based on cumulative
      performance across three structured phases: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

    <h2>1. Dataset Analysis</h2>
    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>By Domain</h3>
        <table>

    <p>
      The dataset combines the original hand-crafted <em>LLM_Interview_Dataset-v2</em>
      with three open-source Hugging Face corpora
      (<code>Aiman1234/Interview-questions</code>,
       <code>K-areem/AI-Interview-Questions</code>,
       <code>Shreyash23/interview</code>),
      resulting in <strong>{dataset_stats['total_rows']:,} total rows</strong> and
      <strong>{dataset_stats['unique_q']:,} unique question concepts</strong>.
      Domain assignment used keyword-frequency matching across 4 categories;
      difficulty labels from source datasets were preserved where available.

    <p>
      Using LoRA with <em>r</em>=16 targets a rank-to-dimension ratio of
      <strong>16/2048 = 0.78%</strong> per attention layer, acting only on
      <code>q_proj</code> and <code>v_proj</code> — the projections most
      directly responsible for attention pattern specialisation.
      The alpha/r scaling factor of <strong>2.0</strong> is a standard practice that
      ensures stable gradient flow without excessive adaptation noise.

    <p>
      The loss curve demonstrates healthy convergence: a steep initial drop in the
      first epoch followed by smooth refinement. The loss dropped
      <strong>{training['loss_reduction']}%</strong> from
      <strong>{training['initial_loss']}</strong> to <strong>{training['final_loss']}</strong>,
      indicating strong adaptation without signs of divergence or catastrophic forgetting.

  <!-- SECTION 3: JUSTIFICATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Design Choice Justification</h2>
    <h3>Why LoRA Fine-Tuning?</h3>
    <blockquote>{justification['lora_rationale']}</blockquote>
    <h3>Why Qwen1.5-1.8B?</h3>
    <blockquote>{justification['model_rationale']}</blockquote>
    <h3>Scoring Guardrails</h3>
    <blockquote>{justification['guardrail_rationale']}</blockquote>
    <h3>Adaptive Difficulty Engine</h3>
    <p>
      The interview is structured into three mandatory phases:
      <strong>Easy (5 questions)</strong> &rarr;
      <strong>Medium (8 questions)</strong> &rarr;
      <strong>Hard (5 questions, conditional on Medium avg &ge; 70%)</strong>.
      This mirrors real-world technical screenings where initial warm-up questions
      calibrate baseline competency before progressing to advanced topics.
